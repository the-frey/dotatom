# Lisp Paredit for Atom

Lisp Paredit provides [paredit](http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html) style
functionality for the [Atom](http://atom.io) text editor. It also features basic
syntax checking, syntax error highlighting and a strict mode.
Lisp Paredit only works for lisps and won't have any effect for other syntaxes. It is
based on the excellent [paredit.js](http://robert.kra.hn/projects/paredit-js) library.

## Features
 - Barfing and slurping
 - Navigating s-expressions
 - Killing s-expressions
 - Idiomatic Lisp indentation
 - Syntax checking and error highlighting

## Installing
Search package installer for `lisp paredit` or use the command line:

`apm install lisp-paredit`

## Options
Lisp Paredit can operate in strict or non-strict modes, via the setting in preferences.

You can also disable Lisp Paredit at any time which will unbind the keymap.
